# Repository Guidelines
## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` React app source (components, hooks, utils). Entry: `src/main.jsx` mounted by `index.html`.
- `src/index.css` Tailwind entry; co-locate component styles next to components.
- `public/` for static assets served as‑is (create if needed). Place logos/fonts here.
- `dist/` build output (generated by Vite). Do not edit.
- Config: `vite.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`.
- Tests: if adding tests, place in `src/**/__tests__` or `*.test.jsx` next to code.
## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev` — start Vite dev server with React Fast Refresh.
- `npm run build` — production build to `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` — serve the built `dist/` locally for verification.
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint across `src/` (no warnings allowed).
## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: React 18 with JSX, ES Modules.
- Indentation: 2 spaces; prefer named exports.
- Components: `PascalCase` files and component names (e.g., `FloorMap.jsx`).
- Hooks/utilities: `camelCase` (e.g., `useExtinguisherFilter.js`).
- CSS: Use Tailwind utilities; extract reusable patterns into components.
- Linting: ESLint with `react`, `react-hooks`, and `react-refresh` plugins. Fix issues before PRs.
## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: choose Jest + React Testing Library (recommended). Keep tests fast and deterministic.
- Naming: mirror source path, `*.test.jsx` or `__tests__/Component.test.jsx`.
- Coverage: target meaningful paths; add tests for new logic and bug fixes.
- Run: `npm test` once added; integrate with CI as needed.
## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: concise imperative subject (max ~72 chars). Group related changes.
  - Example: `feat(ui): highlight overdue inspections` or `fix(data): correct CSV import off‑by‑one`.
- PRs: include summary, screenshots/GIFs for UI, reproduction steps for fixes, and link issues.
- Keep diffs focused; update docs and `CHANGELOG` notes in the PR description if user‑visible.
## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit secrets. Use environment files: create `.env.local` for dev; reference via `import.meta.env`.
- Validate and sanitize any file inputs (e.g., XLSX parsing with `xlsx`).
- Review third‑party additions; prefer audited, minimal dependencies.
## Architecture Overview
- Vite + React front‑end; Tailwind for styling; `lucide-react` for icons; `xlsx` for spreadsheet import/export. Keep state local to features; lift state only when shared.
