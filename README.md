### Mobile-First Design

- Fully responsive interface works on phones, tablets, and desktops
- Touch-optimized buttons and controls
- Long-press gestures for quick workspace switching
- Camera integration for photo capture and barcode scanning
- GPS location services for asset mapping
- Works great on hospital Wi-Fi or cellular data

### Security Features

- Firebase Authentication with email/password
- User-scoped data (users only see their own data)
- Workspace-scoped data isolation
- Firestore security rules enforce user isolation
- Storage security rules protect uploaded photos
- Admin mode toggle for sensitive operations

### Performance

- React 18 with Fast Refresh for instant development updates
- Vite build system for lightning-fast builds
- Real-time Firestore listeners for instant data sync
- Optimized photo thumbnails and lazy loading
- Efficient filtering and sorting algorithms

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Scanner Not Working
- **Check browser permissions**: Allow camera access when prompted
- **Use HTTPS**: Camera API requires secure connection (or localhost)
- **Try different browser**: Chrome/Edge have best support
- **Check lighting**: Ensure barcode is well-lit and in focus

### GPS Location Issues
- **Enable location services**: Check device settings
- **Allow browser permission**: Grant location access when prompted
- **Wait for high accuracy**: GPS may take 5-10 seconds to achieve best accuracy
- **Move to open area**: GPS works best with clear view of sky

### Data Not Syncing
- **Check internet connection**: Firestore requires connectivity
- **Verify Firebase config**: Ensure `src/firebase.js` is properly configured
- **Check console for errors**: Open browser DevTools for detailed error messages
- **Verify Firestore rules**: Ensure security rules allow authenticated access

### Photos Not Uploading
- **Check Storage rules**: Verify Firebase Storage security rules
- **Verify file size**: Large photos may take time to upload
- **Check internet speed**: Slow connections may timeout
- **Try smaller photos**: Compress images if necessary

### Import Failing
- **Check file format**: Only CSV, XLS, and XLSX supported
- **Verify column names**: Should include "Asset ID", "Serial", "Vicinity", "Parent Location"
- **Check for special characters**: Some characters may cause parsing issues
- **Try smaller batches**: Import in chunks if file is very large

### Workspace Issues
- **Missing workspaces**: Legacy data auto-migrates on first login
- **Can't switch months**: Long-press the month badge for 0.5 seconds
- **Lost data**: Check you're viewing the correct workspace/month

## Roadmap

Future enhancements under consideration:

- [ ] Offline mode with background sync when connection returns
- [ ] Scheduled notifications for upcoming inspections
- [ ] Barcode printing integration for new assets
- [ ] Advanced analytics and trend reporting
- [ ] Multi-user collaboration features
- [ ] Mobile app versions (iOS/Android)
- [ ] QR code generation for quick asset access
- [ ] Integration with work order systems
- [ ] Automated monthly report email distribution
- [ ] Custom checklist templates per building/section
