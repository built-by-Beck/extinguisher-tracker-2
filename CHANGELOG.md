# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — 2026-01-29

Unified inspection UI across all entry points.

- Added: Route scan, list, and manual search flows through `ExtinguisherDetailView` for a single, consistent inspection experience.
- Changed: Consolidated duplicate views and simplified navigation/state management.
- Notes: Backwards-compatible UX consolidation; no breaking API/route changes expected.
